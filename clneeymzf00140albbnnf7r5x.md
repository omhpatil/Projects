Algorithms are the key to software engineering. Every beginner has this question in their mind about how to start with algorithms and data structures or how to be good at it. Here in this article, I am going to share five tips that will help you in your journey!

## 1\. Fundamentals

Initially, focus on the basics of DSA(Data-Structures and Algorithms). You can watch online tutorials, courses, books or YouTube videos, whatever you are comfortable with is available in the market. Go through all the notes, and read the documentation; although it is not possible to read all documentation, at least read important ones. You can start with basics such as,

* Time and space complexity analysis
    
* Big O notation
    
* Recursion
    
* Basic data structures such as arrays, matrices, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
    
* Basic algorithms such as searching algorithms and sorting algorithms.
    

## 2\. Math

Being good at math will help you a lot. Even if you are not, there is nothing to be worried about, all you have to do is practice some basic concepts such as - set theory, finite-state machines, regular expressions, etc.

## 3\. Implementation

This is the most essential part of your coding journey, no matter how many courses you purchase, or how many tutorials you see, all is a waste of money and time unless you get your hands DIRTY by code!

Try to implement the logic, and algorithm on your own; if you fail, Congrats! You just got one step closer to your goal. Try again, fail again, try again and fail once again. Through this process, you will get a lot to know.

Don't forget to google out things, even the basic ones. Building Logic comes from practising the questions. Try to solve the problems on various sites, and understand the logic behind them, you can also get help from your professors or friends. This will eventually build logic.

## 4\. Challenges

Solve algorithm problems on [**HACKERRANK**](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) that provide explanations and solutions.

Also, check out the Discussion tab for each problem after you have solved the problem, or if you got stuck anywhere, this will help you to look into other people's code and understand their logic for solving the same problem. This way you will get to know yet another logic.

## 5\. Interview Questions

After doing all this, check the interview questions and try to solve them. This will boost your confidence and help you in many ways. Even if you were not able to solve, don't get discouraged, read an editorial section or check the discussion tab, ask your friends but don't STOP!

### Final Thoughts

Donâ€™t forget that,

> ***Consistency is the key! So don't stop!***
