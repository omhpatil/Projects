Almost all of us have seen QR codes before, they are everywhere now, from making payments, or packaging gadgets or on business cards. Companies and even people nowadays use QR codes to give information that is quickly accessible and can be seen even with a smartphone. But have you ever wondered why there are 3 big squares in every QR code we have come across?

First, let's take a look at what are these QR's.

So, the term QR stands for Quick Response Code. QR codes are square barcodes (two-dimensional barcodes) that were first developed and used in Japan. Like any other barcode, a QR code is nothing more than a way to store information in a machine-readable optical label. The data contained by a QR code can be anything from simple text to email addresses, phone numbers, and so on.

QR codes store data using patterns of black dots and white spaces arranged in a square grid. These patterns can be scanned and translated into human-readable information, with the help of an imaging device, like a camera or a scanner.

## But why these 3 big squares?

We can experiment to understand this:

Attached below is a reference key. You don't have to remember it, you can always look at it any time you need.

Now, I want you to compare the below character to the key and identify it.

Well, that was pretty easy! Yes, you got it right !! It's number 5. (Even if you didn't find it, there is nothing to be worried about, you can crosscheck now.)

Now, I want you to try this:

It's not that easy anymore, isn't it? But now check the image below.

You can see that when the QR code has squares, the smartphone or any scanning device and quickly figure out a way to rotate and resize the code, turning it into this(below image).

And now you can guess it, right? Yes, it's number 3. This is why there are these 3 big squares. They ensure the codes can be correctly read.
